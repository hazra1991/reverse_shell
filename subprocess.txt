if we want to pipe in subprocess like
  ps -ef| grep 1234

we can do

ps = subprocess.Popen(('ps', '-A'), stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
output = subprocess.check_output(('grep', 'process_name'), stdin=ps.stdout)

To use a pipe with the subprocess module, you have to pass shell=True.

However, this isn't really advisable for various reasons, not least of which is security.
Instead, create the ps and grep processes separately, and pipe the output from one into the other,


ps.wait()
In your particular case, however, the simple solution is to call subprocess.check_output(('ps', '-A')) and then str.find on the output.
